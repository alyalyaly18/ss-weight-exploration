<h1>Gravity Exploration Web App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The "Force of Gravity" Web App allows users to learn about how the gravitational pull of a planet impacts a user's weight and age. The user can choose whether to explore how their weight or age changes by inputing either their current weight or birthdate. Then, the user will choose what planet to explore. The app calculates the new weight and new age based on the users input. There is also an interactive p5.js sketch canvas rendering the planet the user chooses to explore. With the use of the mouse, the user can zoom in, zoom out, and pan the orbiting planet.
